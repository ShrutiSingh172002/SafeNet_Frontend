      <h3>Why We Exist</h3>
      <p>
        SafeNet was born out of a growing concern for the rise in cybercrime targeting individuals and small businesses. We believe that security tools shouldn't be complicated, expensive, or resource-heavy. Our approach focuses on accessibility, ease of use, and intelligent automation that adapts as threats evolve.

      <h3>Our Values</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> We believe users deserve to know how their data is protected and never exploited.</li>
        <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> We invest in cutting-edge research to stay ahead of cybercriminals.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability:</strong> Our software is rigorously tested to ensure it works when you need it most.</li>
        <li><strong>User-Centric Design:</strong> Every feature we build is designed with real users in mind.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
      <p>
        As threats become more sophisticated, so do we. We're continuously upgrading our detection engines, introducing AI-based monitoring, and building tools that empower users to take control of their cybersecurity with confidence. SafeNet is more than just an antivirus — it's your digital defense partner.
